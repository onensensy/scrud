```

### `s-crud:crud`

This command will generate:

- A controller for handling CRUD operations

- System modules are registered

### `s-crud:create-user`

```

You can use `--live` to deploy to a live environment

```bash
php artisan s-crud:deploy --live
```

## Usage

### Scaffolding CRUD Operations

To scaffold CRUD operations for a model:

```bash
php artisan s-crud:crud ModelName
```

This will generate the necessary controller, views, and routes to manage records for your model.

### Customizing Templates

You can customize the generated templates by editing the files in `resources/views/vendor/scrud/`.

### Configuration

You can configure the package by editing the configuration file located at `config/scrud.php`.

## Example

To scaffold CRUD operations for a `Product` model:

First, set up the model and migration:

```bash
php artisan s-crud:setup Product
```

Optionally, use the `--m` flag to create only the model:

```bash
php artisan s-crud:setup Product --m
```

After modifying the generated files as needed, you can scaffold the CRUD operations:

```bash
php artisan s-crud:crud Product
```

This will generate the necessary controller, views, and routes to manage products in your application.
